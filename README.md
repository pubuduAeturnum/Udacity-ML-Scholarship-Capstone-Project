# Udacity-ML-Scholarship-Capstone-Project
The final Project Proposal of the Udacity-ML-Scholarship-Capstone-Project

# Supporting Materials:  
- The ConvAI2 dataset is required for this research and can be acquired from the PyTorch website. The dataset may be downloaded here:
 - https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_downloads/convai2_fairseq.tar.gz
- We may also use pre-trained transformer-based language models such as BERT or GPT-2, which can be obtained from the Hugging Face Transformers library:
 - https://huggingface.co/models
- We may also need to download Python libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, and NLTK for data preparation, model training, and assessment. Pip, Anaconda, or any other package management may be used to install these libraries.
- There are no extra pictures or input files required for this project since the ConvAI2 dataset provides all of the data required for training and testing the chatbot.
